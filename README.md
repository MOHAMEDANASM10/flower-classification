# 🌼 Iris Flower Classification Web App

This project is part of my AI & ML internship with **NSP NEXUS**. The goal is to classify **iris flower species** based on their petal and sepal dimensions using a machine learning model and provide an interactive way for users to test it.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification problems. This project:
- Trains a machine learning model (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Predicts the flower species: `Setosa`, `Versicolor`, or `Virginica`
- Allows users to test predictions by entering their own measurements
- Is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**

---

## 💡 Features

✅ Load and explore the Iris dataset  
✅ Visualize data distributions and relationships  
✅ Train a simple KNN model  
✅ Evaluate accuracy and confusion matrix  
✅ Let users input custom measurements and predict species  
✅ Deploy as a Streamlit web app

## 📊 Sample Inputs for Testing

| Sepal Length | Sepal Width | Petal Length | Petal Width | Expected Species |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4          | 0.2         | Setosa 🌸        |
| 6.0          | 2.8         | 4.35         | 1.3         | Versicolor 🌿     |
| 6.5          | 3.0         | 5.5          | 2.0         | Virginica 🌺      |
